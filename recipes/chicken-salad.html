        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>A <strong>quick weeknight salad with a refreshing crunch and savory sesame flavor</strong>, this recipe relies on rotisserie or leftover cooked chicken. With that done, you’ll have dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes!</p>
        <p>During the busy work week, I love turning to simple salads for dinner, and this is one of my favorites.</p>
        <p>It comes together in less than half an hour and relies on leftover chicken, cold from the fridge, or a rotisserie bird picked up on the way home from work. I can easily prep enough ingredients and extra dressing to store for a quick lunch the day after.</p>
        <p>The chicken is served over a bed of romaine lettuce, cucumbers, and radishes. The dressing is a savory mixture of tahini, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, and honey.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the salad</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced on a bias</li>
            <li>4 ounces daikon radish, cut into thin slices</li>
            <li>1 head (about 1/2 pound) romaine lettuce, leaves separated</li>
            <li>1 English cucumber, quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 pound (about 2 cups) shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the dressing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons tahini</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh ginger, finely grated</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic, finely grated</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips and tricks for making chicken salad</h2>
        <p>A few tips when making this weeknight-friendly sesame salad:</p>
        <Ul>
            <li>Use a thin-skinned cucumber like English, Persian, or Japanese.</li>
            <li>If you don’t have leftover chicken or a rotisserie chicken, you can also poach chicken breasts in salted simmering water until cooked through.</li>
            <li>If the dressing is too thick, add more water, half a tablespoon at a time, until you reach a viscous but pourable consistency.</li>
            <li>I use whole leaves in this salad, which means it’s not a salad you’ll toss together in a bowl and eat with a fork. Rather it’s a plated salad meant to be eaten with a knife and fork for a more satisfying, slow-paced meal. However, if you want to make it just a fork salad, slice the romaine and toss everything together with the dressing in the serving bowl.</li>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Prep the salad ingredients:</h3>
                <p>In a small bowl of iced water, soak the scallions and radish until ready to use. This will keep them crisp.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Make the dressing:</h3>
                <p>In a small bowl, whisk the tahini, water, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, honey, grated ginger and garlic, and salt until very smooth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Assemble the salad:</h3>
                <p>Divide lettuce leaves, cucumbers, radishes, and shredded chicken between 4 serving plates. Drizzle each portion generously with tahini dressing. Top with drained and dried scallions, then garnish with toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately.</p>
