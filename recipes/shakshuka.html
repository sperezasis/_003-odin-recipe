        <h2>What is Shakshuka?</h2>
        <p>Shakshuka, a dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce, has its origins in North Africa, but it has migrated to the Middle East and is now pretty much known all over the world, especially in Israel, where it is practically a national specialty.</p>
        <p>While many versions (like this one) have a tomato and pepper base, there are plenty of variations. Add harissa to the sauce and serve it with a dollop of yogurt or labne (labneh) a strained, thickened yogurt.</p>
        <p>Make a minty tomato sauce with jalapeno for a change or skip the tomatoes and make a green shakshuka with herbs, greens, and cream. You could also make it with fresh summer vegetables and pesto like this one. Other additions might include artichokes, greens, cannellini beans, chickpeas, or even diced potatoes. The concept is open to improvisation, so go for it!</p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Cook the onion and peppers:</h3>
                <p>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the paprika, cumin, and pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds to a minute to bloom the spices.</p>
                <p>Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add the garlic, red pepper, and yellow pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables soften.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Crush the tomatoes and simmer them with the peppers:</h3>
                <p>In a bowl, break up the tomatoes with your hands. Add them to the skillet with the salt and cook for 5 minutes. Taste and add more salt, if you prefer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cook the eggs:</h3>
                <p>With the back of a spoon or a ladle, make 4 indentations in the sauce.</p>
                <p>Break an egg into a cup and carefully pour it into and indentation, being careful not to break the yolk. Repeat with the remaining eggs. (You can crack the egg directly into the sauce and skip the cup, but it’s easier to get a an errant egg shell or protect the dish from a bad egg if you use the cup method.)</p>
                <p>Sprinkle the feta and olives around the eggs. Cover the pan and simmer over medium heat for 8 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still soft. (If you like your eggs well done, cook for a minute or two longer.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>To serve:</h3>
                <p>Garnish with cilantro leaves and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. Bring to the table and serve from the pan.</p>
